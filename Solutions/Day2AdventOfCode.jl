##The function getGameIDSum takes a series of lines from a game where a series of balls are taken out and then returned
##The function returns two outputs:
##runningCounter: the sum of the games (numbered 1 to the number of games) that would be possible if there were only 12 red balls, 13 blue balls, and 14 green balls
#runningPower: The minimum number of balls needed for each round to be possible in each game, taken to their power (red * blue * green) for each game, then added up
