##The function getTotal takes a series of lines and adds the first and last number together for each line, and then outputs the total 
#filename: the name of the input file
#mode: "digit" or "word"; "digit" only counts numbers if they are 0-9, while "word" converts words to digits (ex: "zero" => 0)
